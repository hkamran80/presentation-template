# Presentation Template

This is a custom presentation template I created for myself using React and Tailwind
CSS.

Check out [the demo on my website](https://presentation-demo.hkamran.com/?ref=github).

## Usage

1. Clone this repository
2. Install dependencies with your package manager of choice

   For example, `pnpm install`

3. Add or edit the slides in the `slides` folder
4. Update the `configuration.tsx` file with your desired slide order, slide configuration,
   and presentation configuration
5. Deploy

## References

This template is built using code from [`turbo-slides`](https://github.com/turbo-eth/turbo-slides).
The main differences are that this template is a lot slimmer, written in TypeScript,
and doesn't use MDX.
